The three most common Transformer architectures are:

### 1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
   - **Use Case**: BERT is primarily used for natural language understanding tasks. Its bidirectional training allows it to understand the context of a word based on all of its surrounding words, making it highly effective for tasks like:
     - **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection, etc.
     - **Question Answering**: Extracting answers from text based on a given question.
     - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names, dates, and locations in text.
     - **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of long documents.
     - **Language Translation**: Converting text from one language to another.

### 2. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
   - **Use Case**: GPT models are designed for natural language generation tasks. They are autoregressive, meaning they generate text one word at a time, making them well-suited for:
     - **Text Generation**: Generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a prompt.
     - **Chatbots and Conversational AI**: Building systems that can carry on human-like conversations.
     - **Story and Content Creation**: Generating stories, articles, or creative content.
     - **Code Generation**: Writing code snippets or entire programs based on natural language prompts.
     - **Translation**: Converting text from one language to another, especially in a more generative and creative context.

### 3. **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**
   - **Use Case**: T5 is a versatile model that treats every NLP problem as a text-to-text problem, meaning both input and output are text strings. This makes T5 adaptable to a wide range of tasks, including:
     - **Text Summarization**: Condensing a long piece of text into a shorter summary.
     - **Question Answering**: Answering questions based on a given context or passage.
     - **Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
     - **Text Classification**: Classifying text into different categories, such as sentiment analysis.
     - **Text Generation**: Generating coherent and contextually relevant text for a variety of applications.

These architectures have become foundational in NLP due to their flexibility and ability to handle a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. They have been widely adopted across industries, including healthcare, finance, customer service, and more, to build intelligent systems that understand and generate human language.
