To download the Eigen C++ library, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to download the Eigen library.
3. Run the following command to clone the Eigen repository from GitHub:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror.git
    ```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, you will have the Eigen library files in the specified directory.

Please note that Eigen is a header-only library, so there is no need to build or install it. You can simply include the necessary headers in your C++ code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
